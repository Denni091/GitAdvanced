Snakes are elongated, limbless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes /sɜːrˈpɛntiːz/.
Like all other squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales.
Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors,
enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads (cranial kinesis).
